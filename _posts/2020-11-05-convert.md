We have a daily file transfer that comes from JP Morgan that shows which entity have made payments on their property tax.

Historically, the file has always been transferred through FTP from a Unix server to a Windows system.
On Unix, it’s LF character (\n, 0A or 10 in decimal) is used to signify the end of a line while on windows, it’s a sequence of two characters, CR and LF (\r + \n, 0D + 0A or 13 + 10 in decimal).In order to account for this discrepancy, many file transfer clients and servers support a text/ASCII transfer mode

## Text/ASCII Transfer Mode

A primary difference is that different character or sequence of characters is used to signify an end of a line. On Unix, it’s LF character (\n, 0A or 10 in decimal). On Windows, it’s a sequence of two characters, CR and LF (\r + \n, 0D + 0A or 13 + 10 in decimal).
In order for the file to be processed,it needs to include 
The transfer mode is setup in ASCII mode to account for the different Operating systems 


Python code block:
```python
    # Author: Brian Maina
# Date: 11/12/2019

# replacement strings
WINDOWS_LINE_ENDING = b'\r\n'
UNIX_LINE_ENDING = b'\n'

import time
timestr = time.strftime("X:/TTA%m%d%y.txt")
## print(timestr)

# relative or absolute file path, e.g.:
file_path = timestr

with open(file_path, 'rb') as open_file:
    content = open_file.read()

content = content.replace(UNIX_LINE_ENDING, WINDOWS_LINE_ENDING)

with open(file_path, 'wb') as open_file:
    open_file.write(content)
```
