We have a daily file transfer that comes from JP Morgan that shows which entities have made payments on their property tax.

Historically, the file has always been transferred through FTP from a Unix server to a Windows system.
On Unix, the "LF" character (\n, 0A or 10 in decimal) is used to signify the end of a line while on windows,itâ€™s a sequence of two characters, CR and LF (\r + \n, 0D + 0A or 13 + 10 in decimal).
In order to account for this discrepancy, many file transfer clients and servers support a text/ASCII transfer mode

## Text/ASCII Transfer Mode

When transferring a file in this mode, the file gets (ideally) converted from the native format to a source system format and vice versa.Meaning the file endings that we get for our bank's Unix server should be automatically be converted from LF to CRLF.

For some odd reason,the ASCII transfer mode failed.This python script however fixes that by using the replace() method to convert the line endings for the current daily file


Python code block:
```python
    # Author: Brian Maina
  # Date: 11/12/2020

# replacement strings
WINDOWS_LINE_ENDING = b'\r\n'
UNIX_LINE_ENDING = b'\n'

import time
timestr = time.strftime("X:/TTA%m%d%y.txt")
## print(timestr)

# relative or absolute file path, e.g.:
file_path = timestr

with open(file_path, 'rb') as open_file:
    content = open_file.read()

content = content.replace(UNIX_LINE_ENDING, WINDOWS_LINE_ENDING)

with open(file_path, 'wb') as open_file:
    open_file.write(content)
```
